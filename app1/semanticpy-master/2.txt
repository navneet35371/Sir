Editorials for all rounds starting from SRM 467 can be edited by any TopCoder member. It can be language correction, wording improvement or additional explanation in some parts, your additional comments, description of alternative solutions, etc. If you want to improve the wording of editorial writer or correct some language error, please feel free to put your change over the original text. And if you wish to add a comment or describe another approach, there's a section for this at the bottom of each problem.
 

 
Before editing, please be sure to check the following guidelines .
 

 
If you see that you occasionally broken the page formatting, you can use page history page (like this ) to restore the latest proper version. If you don't see how to do that, please contact admins (contest@topcoder.com).

    You can use recursive wget for the editorials. 

 Note, however, that redistributing these files is possibly a copyright violation, so they would have to be for private use only.

I removed old comments regarding issues that have been fixed before. 
 
Let me create a small FAQ about the problem set analysis page. 
 
 Q. Where is the editorial for SRM XXX? 
 Certain matches don&apos;t have editorials. A typical reason is that the SRM in question was a Member SRM. Member SRMs problem sets were completely voluntary work and many times no one wrote an editorial for them. In other situations, the SRM may have had technical issues strong enough to make it have no statistics. In some of those cases no editorial was added. 
 If a match misses a link here, it is usually because the editorial does not exist or is incomplete. However, if you do find an editorial that does not have a link in this page, please report it.

    I found SRM582 is not listed in Chronological list. 

 It's only listed in Child Page List. 

 Can someone add it?

Vim Cookbook 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 Vim Cookbook 
 by Steve Oualline 
 
This is the Vim cookbook page. It contains short recipes for doing
many simple and not so simple things in Vim . You should already
know the basics of Vim , however each command is explained in detail.
 
 
Each set of instructions is a complete package. Feel free to pick
and choose what you need.

 Character twiddling 
 
If you type fast your fingers can easily get ahead of your mind. Frequently
people transpose characters. For example the word "the" comes out "teh". 
To swap two characters, for example "e" with "h", put the cursor on the cursor
on the "e" and type xp . 
 
The "x" command deletes a character (the "e") and the "p" pastes it after the
cursor (which is now placed over the "h".)
 
 
Interactively replacing one word with another (n. method) 
Suppose you want to replace every occurrence of the word "idiot" with the word
"manager". But you want the chance to review each change before you do it. 
Here's what you do:
 
 
 
  1. 
  1G 
  Go to the top of the document 
 
 
  2. 
  /idiot&lt;enter&gt; 
  Find the first occurrence of the word "idiot" 
 
 
  3. 
  cwmanager 
  Change the word ( cw ) to manager. 
 
 
  4. 
  n 
  Repeat the last search (find the next idiot.) 
 
 
  5. 
  . 
  Repeat the last edit (change one word to manager)
  
	(If you do not want to change the word, skip this step.) 
 
 
 
Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you have replaced all occurred.
 
 
 
 The Virgin What!? 
 
A church had just bought their first computer and were learning how to
use it. The church secretary decided to set up a form letter to be used in a
funeral service. Where the person's name was to be she put in the word
"&lt;name&gt;". When a funeral occurred she would change this word to the
actual name of the departed.
 
 
One day, there were two funerals, first for a lady named Mary, then later one
for someone named Edna. So the secretary used global replace to change
"&lt;name&gt;" to "Mary." So far so good. Next she generated the service for
the second funeral by changing the word "Mary" to "Edna." That was a mistake 
 
 
Imagine the Minister's surprise when he started reading the part containing the
Apostle's Creed and saw, "Born of the Virgin Edna." 
 
 
 
Interactively replacing one word with another (command line method) 
Suppose you want to replace every occurrence of the word "idiot" with the word
"manager". But you want the chance to review each change before you do it. 
Execute the command:
 
:%s/\&lt;idiot\&gt;/manager/gc
 
 
This command will make the change and pause after each change to give you 
a chance to confirm it. You can enter "y" to accept the change or 
"n" to not accept it.
 
The parts of this command are:
 
 
 
  : 
  Enter command mode 
 
 
  % 
  Perform this command on all lines (% is a synomim
 for the first to last line.) 
 
 
  s 
  The short form of the :substitute command. 
 
 
  /\&lt;idiot\&gt;/ 
  This text specifies the text we are looking for wand
 want. The \&lt; tells Vim to match a word
 start and the \&gt; tells Vim to match the 
 end of a word. 
 
 
  /manager/ 
  The replacement text 
 
 
  gc 
  The flags. These are
   
	  g Global -- Change every occurance, not use
	 the first one on each line 
	  c Confirm -- Ask before making each change 
	 
  
 
 
 
 
 Replacing one word with another using one command 
Suppose you want to replace every occurrence of the word "idiot" with the word
"manager". No confirmation needed because all idiots are managers.
 
Use the command:
 
:%s/\&lt;idiot\&gt;/manager/g
 
 
The parts of this command are:
 
 
 
  : 
  Enter command mode 
 
 
  % 
  Perform this command on all lines (% is a synomim
 for the first to last line.) 
 
 
  s 
  The short form of the :substitute command. 
 
 
  /\&lt;idiot\&gt;/ 
  This text specifies the text we are looking for wand
 want. The \&lt; tells Vim to match a word
 start and the \&gt; tells Vim to match the 
 end of a word. 
 
 
  /manager/ 
  The replacement text 
 
 
  g 
  Global flag -- This flag tells Vim to change 
 every occurance on the line, not use the first one. 
 
 
 
 
 Moving Text ( Vi style commands) 
 
Suppose you want to move a paragraphs from the top of the document to the
bottom. There are several ways of doing this. In this example, we
do it using Vi style command. In the next section
 Moving Text (Visual mode) we do it using 
using the Vim visual commands.
 
 
To do the move the commands:
 
 
 
  Command 
  Explaination 
 
 
  1. 
  
  Move the cursor to the top of the paragraph you want to move. 
 
 
  2. 
  ma 
  Place a mark named "a" at this location. ( Vim 
  will give you no indication that this command has been
	executed. In other words, the screen will not change.) 
 
 
  3. 
  
  Move the cursor to the bottom of the paragraph to be moved. 
 
 
  4. 
  d'a 
  Delete to mark "a". This puts the deleted text in a cut buffer. 
 
 
  5. 
  
  Move the cursor to line where the text is to go. 
 The paragraph will be placed after this one. 
 
 
  6. 
  p 
  Paste the text in below the cursor. 
 
 
 
 Moving Text (Visual Method) 
 
Suppose you want to move a paragraphs from the top of the document to the
bottom. There are several ways of doing this. In this example, we
do it using the Vim Visual mode. In the previous section
 Moving Text (old method) we do it using 
using the Vi style commands.
 
 
To do the move the commands:
 
 
 
  Command 
  Explaination 
 
 
  1. 
  
  Move the cursor to the top of the paragraph you want to move. 
 
 
  2. 
  v 
  Start visual mode. (If you want to move only full lines, use
 the V command which starts visual line mode. 
 
 
  3. 
  
  Move the cursor to the bottom of the paragraph to be moved.
 The text to be moved will be hightlighted. 
 
 
  4. 
  d 
  Perform a visual delete. In other words delete the highlighted
 text. 
 
 
  5. 
  
  Move the cursor to line where the text is to go. 
 The paragraph will be placed after this one. 
 
 
  6. 
  p 
  Paste the text in below the cursor. 
 
 
 
 Copying a block of text from one file to another 
 (Vi Style) 
 
There is more than one way to copy text between files. In this section
we use the more triditionally Vi commands. In the next section
 Copying using visual mode , we 
perform the same operations using the Visual mode.
 
To copy a block of text between files execute the commands:
 
 
  Command 
  Explaination 
 
 
	 1. 
	 
	 Edit the file containing the text you want to copy. 
 
 
	 2. 
	 
	 Go to the top line to be copied. 
 
 
	 3. 
	 ma 
	 Mark this line as mark "a". 
 
 
	 4. 
	 
	 Go to the bottom line to be copied 
 
 
	 5. 
	 y'a 
	 Yank ( y ) the text from the current
	cursor location to the mark "a" ( 'a )
	 
 
 
	 6. 
	 :split second-file 
	 Open another window containing the second file.
	(This the file in which the text is to be inserted.) 
 
 
	 7. 
	 
	 Go to the line where the insert is to occur. 
	The text will be place after this line. 
 
 
	 8. 
	 p 
	 Put the text after the cursor. 
 
 
 
 
Copying a block of text from one file to another 
 (Visual Method) 
 
There is more than one way to copy text between files. In this section
we use the newer visual mode commands. See the previous section for
the older
 Vi Style of doing things.
 
To copy a block of text between files execute the commands:
 
 
  Command 
  Explaination 
 
 
	 1. 
	 
	 Edit the file containing the text to be copied. 
 
 
	 2. 
	 
	 Go to the top line to be copied. 
 
 
	 3. 
	 v 
	 Start visual mode. If you want to copy a block of
	full lines, use V to go start
	Visual Line Mode 
 
 
	 4. 
	 
	 Go to the bottom line to be copied. The text to be
	copied will be hightlighted. 
 
 
	 5. 
	 y 
	 Yank ( y ) the text.
	 
 
 
	 6. 
	 :split second-file 
	 Open another window containing the second file.
	(This the file in which the text is to be inserted.) 
 
 
	 7. 
	 
	 Go to the line where the insert is to occur. 
	The text will be place after this line. 
 
 
	 8. 
	 p 
	 Put the text after the cursor. 
 
 
 Sorting a section ( Vi Style) 
 
Frequently you will be editing a file with a list of names in it. For example,
a list of object files that make up a program.
 
 
For example:
 
	version.o 	
	pch.o		
	getopt.o 	
	util.o		
	getopt1.o	
	inp.o		
	patch.o		
	backupfile.o
 
 
This list would be nice in alphabetical order. Or at least ASCII order. To
alphabetize this list execute the commands:
 
 
 
  Command 
  Explaination 
 
 
  1. 
  
  Move the cursor to the first line to be sorted. 
 
 
  2. 
  ma 
  Mark the first line as mark a . 
 
 
  3. 
  
  Move to the bottom of the text to be sorted. 
 
 
  4. 
  !'asort 
  The ! command tells Vim to 
run the text through UNIX command. The 'a tell the 
editor that the text to be worked on starts at the
current line and ends at mark a . 
The command that the text is to go through
is sort .
 
 
 
The result looks like:
 
 
	backupfile.o
	getopt.o 	
	getopt1.o	
	inp.o	
	patch.o		
	pch.o		
	util.o		
	version.o 	
 
 
  Warning 
 
 
In actual practice what you in most Makefile s (file that
are used by UNIX to control compilation) looks more like:
 
 
OBJS = \
  version.o  \
  pch.o   \
  getopt.o  \
  util.o   \
  getopt1.o  \
  inp.o   \
  patch.o   \
  backupfile.o
 
 
Notice that the backslash (\) is used to indicate a continuation line. 
After sorting this looks like:
 
 
OBJS = \
  backupfile.o
  getopt.o  \
  getopt1.o  \
  inp.o   \
  patch.o   \
  pch.o   \
  util.o   \
  version.o  \
 
 
The names are in order, but the backslashes are wrong. Don't forget to fix
them using normal editing before continuing.
 
 
OBJS = \
  backupfile.o \
  getopt.o  \
  getopt1.o  \
  inp.o   \
  patch.o   \
  pch.o   \
  util.o   \
  version.o
 
 
 Sorting a section (Visual Method) 
 
Frequently you will be editing a file with a list of names in it. For example,
a list of object files that make up a program.
 
 
For example:
 
	version.o 	
	pch.o		
	getopt.o 	
	util.o		
	getopt1.o	
	inp.o		
	patch.o		
	backupfile.o
 
 
This list would be nice in alphabetical order. Or at least ASCII order. To
alphabetize this list execute the commands:
 
 
 
  Command 
  Explaination 
 
 
  1. 
  
  Move the cursor to the first line to be sorted. 
 
 
  2. 
  V 
  Enter visual line mode 
 
 
  3. 
  
  Move to the bottom of the text to be sorted. 
 
 
  4. 
  !sort 
  The ! command tells Vim to 
 run the hightlighted text through UNIX command. 
 The command that the text is to go through
 is sort .
 
 
 Warning 
 
Check out the sort warning section for
a short description of the problems that can result from using this
command.
 
 Dealing with Makefile and other SOB files 
 
One problem with the file format used by the UNIX make command is that
it's extremely fussy.
 
 
For example, the following is correct:
 
 
  prog: prog.c
    cc -g -o prog prog.c
 
 
The following is not:
 
  prog: prog.c
    cc -g -o prog prog.c
 
 
At first glance you might think that these two are exactly. But look closer.
The "cc" line of the first one begins with a tab. The second one begins with
eight spaces. (You can't tell the difference between a space and a tab when
it's printed on the screen! You need a better video card.)
 
So how are you supposed to tell them apart especially when one the screen (or
the printed page) they look exactly the same.
 
The answer is you can't. You might think that's a bit unfair. Especially when
 make works on the first one but not the second. But who every said UNIX
was fair.
 
Fortunately Vim has a mode that tells you exactly what's in your file.
Executing the command
 
 
	 :set list 
 
puts you into this mode. When the display is set into "list mode" all
characters print. Tabs show up as "^I" and the end of line shows up as $. So
in list mode, our two examples look like:
 
  prog: prog.c$
  ^Icc -g -o prog prog.c$
 
 
and
 
  prog: prog.c$
    cc -g -o prog prog.c$
 
 
From this it's easy to see which line has the tab.
 
 Formatting a text paragraph 
 
The Vim editor is not a word processor. 
Boy is it not a word processor.
There are a couple of things you can do to make things better for you when
editing text.
 
Word processors automatically wrap when you type a line 
that's longer than the margins. The Vim editor lets make a 
line as long as you want. By executing the command:
 
   :set wrapmargin=70 
 
 
you can tell Vim to automatically break lines 
when the run longer than 70 characters. 
(You can adjust this number to whatever line length you want.)
 
This makes entering text much easier. 
It doesn't solve the problem of editing.
If you enter a paragraph and then decide to 
delete half the words on the first
line, Vim will not reformat the text.
 
You can force a reformat of a paragraph by executing the commands:
 
 
  Command 
  Explaination 
 
 
  1. 
  
  Move to the top of the paragraph. 
 
 
  2. 
  gq} 
  The "!" command tells Vim to pipe a section of 
 text through a filter. The } tells Vim that 
 the section of text for the pipe command is a single paragraph.
 
 
  3. 
  fmt -70 
  The UNIX command fmt is a primitive formatter. It performs
word-wrapping well enough for text documentation. 
The -70 tells fmt to format lines for 70 characters per line.
 
 
 Finding a procedure in a C program 
 
The Vim program was designed by programmers for programmers. 
You can use it to locate procedures within a set of C or C++ program files.
 
But first you must generate a table of contest file called a "tags" file.
(This file has been given the obvious name tags .) The ctags 
command generates this table of contents files.
 
To generate a table of contents of all the C program files in your current
working directory, use the command:
 
  $ ctags *.c 
 
 
For C++ use the command:
 
  $ ctags *.cpp 
 
 
If you use an extension other than .cpp for your C++ 
files, use it instead of .cpp .
 
Once this file is generated, you tell Vim 
that you want edit a procedure, and it will find the file 
containing that procedure and position you there.
For example if you want to edit the procedure 
write_file use the command:
 
  $ vim -t write_file 
 
 
Now suppose as you are looking at the write_file procedure that it calls
setup_data and you need to look at that procedure. To jump to that function,
position the cursor at the beginning of the word setup_data and press Ctrl+].
This tells Vim to jump to the definition of this procedure. This
repositioning will occur even if Vim has to change files to do so.
 
 Note: 
If you've edited the current file and not saved it, Vim 
will issue a warning and ignore the Ctrl+] command.
 
 Drawing comment boxes 
 
I like to put a big comment box at the top of each of my procedures. For
example:
 
	/*******************************************************
	 * Program -- Solve it -- Solves the worlds problems. *
	 *  All of them. At once. This will be a great *
	 * program when I finish it.       *
	 *******************************************************/
 
 
Drawing these boxes like this is tedious at best. 
But Vim has a nice feature called abbreviations that 
makes things easier.
 
First, you need to create a Vim initialization file called
 ~/.vimrc . (At first this may look like a ex initialization file.
It is. The Vim command is actually a mode of the ex editor.)
 
The ~/.vimrc file need to contain the lines:
 
  :ab #b /************************************************
  :ab #e ************************************************/
 
 
These command define a set of Vim abbreviations.
What's a Vim abbreviation? 
Its a word that stands for another word. When Vim see the
abbreviation, it will expand it to the full word. In this case we've defined
an abbreviation called #b 
that expands to the beginning line of a comment
box. The #e abbreviation does the same thing. 
 
So to create a comment box enter #b&lt;enter&gt;. The screen looks like:
 
  /************************************************
 
Enter the comments, including the beginning and ending "*" characters. 
Finally end the comment by typing #e&lt;enter&gt; . 
This causes the ending comment to be entered.
 
 Note: 
 
This page was written in Vim . So how did we
enter the #b and #e? Easy, we typed in #bb and the deleted a character. 
(We couldn't enter #b or it would have been 
expanded.) 
 
Some other useful commands that programmer may want to put in
their ~/.exrc include:
 
	:set autoindent
	:set autowrite
	:ab #d #define
	:ab #i #include
	:ab #b /************************************************
	:ab #e ************************************************/
	:ab #l /*----------------------------------------------*/
	:set sw=4
 
 
The autoindent setting causes Vim to 
indent new lines by a similar amount
to the one next to them. 
This is very useful for entering programs. The
autowrite setting tells Vim to write the old file out when switching from
one file to another.
 
The abbreviations #d , 
 #i , and #l , 
define useful terms for programmers.
 
Finally, the command set sw=4 sets the shift width 
(the number of characters
text is moved sideways for the shift command 
( &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; )).
 
This is very useful if you use a 4 space indentation for your C or C++
programs. (Studies at Rice University have shown this to be the best
indentation size.)
 
 Reading a man page 
 
You can use the Vim editor to browse through text files. One of the most
useful set of files to browse through is the man pages. To do this
we assemble a pipeline of three command.
 
The first is man which gets the page. The next one, ul 
turns the underline and bold escape codes into something readable, and 
finally we use Vim to broswe the file.
 
So our command is:
 
 
$ man subject | ul -i | vim -
 
 
 
The man page will be generated and then displayed in the Vim 
window. You can now use your normal editing commands to browse the
files.
 
 Removing carriage returns from MS-DOS file 
 
If you ever try to edit a MS-DOS file, you'll notice that each line
ends with a ^M character. This is caused by the funny
way that MS-DOS treats the end-of-line. 
(For some background on this problem take a look at 
 The EOL Story .
 
To remove the ^M characters from a MS-DOS file, enter the command:
 
	 :1,$s/{Ctrl+V}{Ctrl+M}//{Enter} 
 
This command starts with a colon ( : ) to
tell Vim to enter ex mode. All ex 
start with a line number range, in this case its from
the first line (1) to the last ($). The slash indicates
the start of the "from text". The {Ctrl+V} tells Vim 
to treat the next character as a regular character even
if it's a special one.	The next character is {Ctrl+M} .
(This would be treated as {Enter} without the 
 {Ctrl+V} .)
The next slash ends the "from text". What follows is the
"to text" enclosed by slashes.	In this case it's nothing
( // ). 
 
 Trimming the blanks off an end of line 
Some people find spaces and
tabs at the end of a line useless, wasteful, and ugly.
To remove whitespace at the end of every line, execute
the command: 
 
	 :1,$s/[ &lt;tab&gt;]*$// 
 
 
The colon
(:) tells Vim to enter ex command mode. All
 ex commands start with a line range, in this case,
the entire file (line 1 to the last line: $). 
 
The
first set of slashes enclose the "from text". The square
brackets indicate that either character can be a match.
So [ &lt;tab&gt;] matches either space or tab. The star
( * ) means that the previous character specification
(space or tab) can be repeated any of number times.
The dollar ( $ indicates an end of line.	
 
So [ &lt;tab&gt;]*$ 
tells Vim to look for any number of spaces or tabs
followed by an end of line. 
 
These are then replaced by
the text in the next set of slashes. This text is nothing,
so the spaces and tabs are effectively removed. 
 
 Oops, I left the file write protected 
 
Say your editing a file and you've made a lot
of changes. This is a very important file and to preserve
it from any casual changes, you've write protected it,
even against yourself.
 
The Vim editor allows you
to edit a write protected file with little or no warning.
The only trouble is that when you try to exit using " ZZ "
you get the error:
 
 file.txt	File is read only
 
 
and
 Vim doesn't exit. 
 
So what can you do? You don't
want to throw away all those changes, but you need to get
out of Vim so you can turn on write permission.
 
The trick is to execute the :shell command. This command
takes you out of Vim by starting a command processor
(shell) running under Vim You can then write
enable the file:
 
	$ chmod u+w file.txt 
 
and get out of the shell, returning to Vim 
 
	$ exit 
 
 
Finally you need to force Vim to write
the file using the command:
 
	 :w! 
 
(It still thinks the file is write protected so we need to use
the force option ( ! ) to convince it to try writing.)
 
 Note: 
 
It is
a good idea to only spend as short a time as possible in
a command processor started by the :shell command. That's
because it's easy to forget that you're running under
 Vim . It's possible to start a shell, that starts
 Vim , that starts a shell, that starts Vim ,
that .... Using this method you can easily consume a lot
of resources and generate a lot of confusion.
 
By keeping
your :shell sessions short you can avoid lots of trouble.
 
 Changing "Last, First" to "First Last" 
 
You have a list of names in the form:
 
	Last, First
 
 
How to you change them to:
 
	First Last
 
It can be done with one command:
 
  :1,$s/\([^,]*\), \(.*$\)/\2 \1/ 
 
The colon ( : ) tells Vim 
that this is an ex style command.
 
The line range for this command is the whole file as indicated by
the range 1,$ .	
 
The s (substitute) tells Vim 
to do a string substitution.
 
The old text is a complex
regular expression. The \( ... \) delimiters are used
to inform the editor that the text that matches the
regular expression side is to be treated special.
 
The text in the first \( ... \) is assigned to 
 \1 in the replacement text. 
The second set of text inside \( ... \) is assigned 
 \2 and so on.
 
In this case the
first regular expression is any bunch of characters that
does not include a comma. The [^,] means anything but a
comma, the * means a bunch (zero or more characters).
 
The second expression matches anything: .* up to the end
of line: $ .
 
The result of this substitution is that
the first word on the line is assigned to \1 and the
second to \2 . These values are used in the end of the
command to reverse the word.
 
The figure below shows the
relationship between the \( \) 
enclosed strings and the \1 ,
 \2 markers.
 
	:1,$s/\([^,]*\), \(.*$\)/\2 \1/
	  ^^  ^^ ^^ ^^^ ^ ^   
	  ||  || || ||| | +----- String matched by 
	  ||  || || ||| |   first \( \)
	  ||  || || ||| +--------- String matched by
	  ||  || || |||   second \( \)
	  ||  || || ||+----------- Slash separating 
	  ||  || || ||    old/new strings
	  ||  || ++---++------------ Second \( \) 
	  ++-----++--------------------- First \( \)
 
 
The next figure 
breaks out the various parts of the regular
expressions used in this example.
 
	:1,$s/\([^,]*\), \(.*$\)/\2 \1/
		^^^^^ ^^ ^^^
		||||| || ||+--- The end of the line
		||||| || |+---- Repeated 0 or more time
		||||| || +----- Any character
		||||| || +++--- Any character, repeated,
		||||| ||    followed by EOL
		||||| |+-------- The character space
		||||| +--------- The character comma
		||||+------------ Repeated 0 or more times
		|||+------------- Closes the [] expression
		||+-------------- The character comma
		|+--------------- Match anything except the
		|     next character
		+---------------- Starts a set of matches
		++++------------- Match anything but comma
		 +------------ Repeated 0 or more times
		  +--------- Followed by comma
 
 
 How to edit all the files containing a given word 
 
This involves the fgrep 
as well as the special shell character backtick ( ` ).
 
To edit all the C program files that contain the word
 indentation_level execute the command:
 
 $ vim `fgrep -l indentation_level *.c` 
 
 The fgrep -l indentation_level *.c 
searches all the files ending with
 .c for the word and lists them out.
 
Since this command
is enclosed in backtick ( ` ) characters the results of
the command (a list of files) takes the place of the
command on the command line. The Vim editor
is then run on these files. The commands :n{Enter} and
 :rew{Enter} can then be used to browse through the files.
 How to edit all the files containing a given word using the built-in grep 
 
Start Vim .
 
Execute the command:
 
 :grep &gt;word&lt; &gt;file-list&lt; 
 
 
This finds the first location of word in the given files and
positions the cursor on that line. You can use the command
 :cn to find the next occurance.

 8.3. Extracting data from HTML documents
     
 
 
 
 
 
 To extract data from HTML documents, subclass the SGMLParser class and define methods for each tag or entity you want to capture.
    
 
 The first step to extracting data from an HTML document is getting some HTML . If you have some HTML lying around on your hard drive, you can use file functions to read it, but the real fun begins when you get HTML from live web pages.
   
 Example 8.5. Introducing urllib 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib           
 &gt;&gt;&gt; sock = urllib.urlopen( "http://diveintopython.org/" )  
 &gt;&gt;&gt; htmlSource = sock.read()        
 &gt;&gt;&gt; sock.close()           
 &gt;&gt;&gt; print htmlSource          
 &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1'&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Dive Into Python&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;link rel='stylesheet' href='diveintopython.css' type='text/css'&gt;
&lt;link rev='made' href='mailto:mark@diveintopython.org'&gt;
&lt;meta name='keywords' content='Python, Dive Into Python, tutorial, object-oriented, programming, documentation, book, free'&gt;
&lt;meta name='description' content='a free Python tutorial for experienced programmers'&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body bgcolor='white' text='black' link='#0000FF' vlink='#840084' alink='#0000FF'&gt;
&lt;table cellpadding='0' cellspacing='0' border='0' width='100%'&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class='header' width='1%' valign='top'&gt;diveintopython.org&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td width='99%' align='right'&gt;&lt;hr size='1' noshade&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class='tagline' colspan='2'&gt;Python&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;experienced&amp;nbsp;programmers&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt; 

[...snip...] 
 
 
 
 
 The urllib module is part of the standard Python library. It contains functions for getting information about and actually retrieving data from Internet-based URL s (mainly web pages).
      
 
 
 
 
 The simplest use of urllib is to retrieve the entire text of a web page using the urlopen function. Opening a URL is similar to opening a file . The return value of urlopen is a file-like object, which has some of the same methods as a file object.
      
 
 
 
 
 The simplest thing to do with the file-like object returned by urlopen is read , which reads the entire HTML of the web page into a single string. The object also supports readlines , which reads the text line by line into a list.
      
 
 
 
 
 When you're done with the object, make sure to close it, just like a normal file object.
      
 
 
 
 
 You now have the complete HTML of the home page of http://diveintopython.org/ in a string, and you're ready to parse it.
      
 
 
 
 
 Example 8.6. Introducing urllister.py 
 If you have not already done so, you can download this and other examples used in this book.
    
from sgmllib import SGMLParser

 class URLLister (SGMLParser):
  def reset (self):         
  SGMLParser.reset(self)
  self.urls = []

  def start_a (self, attrs):      
  href = [v for k, v in attrs if k== 'href' ]  
   if href:
   self.urls.extend(href) 
 
 
 
 
 reset is called by the __init__ method of SGMLParser , and it can also be called manually once an instance of the parser has been created. So if you need to do any initialization,
      do it in reset , not in __init__ , so that it will be re-initialized properly when someone re-uses a parser instance.
      
 
 
 
 
 start_a is called by SGMLParser whenever it finds an &lt;a&gt; tag. The tag may contain an href attribute, and/or other attributes, like name or title . The attrs parameter is a list of tuples, [( attribute , value ), ( attribute , value ), ...] . Or it may be just an &lt;a&gt; , a valid (if useless) HTML tag, in which case attrs would be an empty list.
      
 
 
 
 
 You can find out whether this &lt;a&gt; tag has an href attribute with a simple multi-variable list comprehension .
      
 
 
 
 
 String comparisons like k=='href' are always case-sensitive, but that's safe in this case, because SGMLParser converts attribute names to lowercase while building attrs .
      
 
 
 
 
 Example 8.7. Using urllister.py 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib, urllister 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; usock = urllib.urlopen( "http://diveintopython.org/" ) 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; parser = urllister.URLLister() 
 &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.feed(usock.read())    
 &gt;&gt;&gt; usock.close()       
 &gt;&gt;&gt; parser.close()      
 &gt;&gt;&gt; for url in parser.urls: print url  
 toc/index.html

... rest of output omitted for brevity ... 
 
 
 
 
 Call the feed method, defined in SGMLParser , to get HTML into the parser. [ 1 ] It takes a string, which is what usock.read() returns.
      
 
 
 
 
 Like files, you should close your URL objects as soon as you're done with them.
      
 
 
 
 
 You should close your parser object, too, but for a different reason. You've read all the data and fed it to the parser, but the feed method isn't guaranteed to have actually processed all the HTML you give it; it may buffer it, waiting for more. Be sure to call close to flush the buffer and force everything to be fully parsed.
      
 
 
 
 
 Once the parser is close d, the parsing is complete, and parser.urls contains a list of all the linked URL s in the HTML document. (Your output may look different, if the download links have been updated by the time you read this.)
      
 
 
 
 
 
 Footnotes 
 
 [ 1 ] The technical term for a parser like SGMLParser is a consumer : it consumes HTML and breaks it down. Presumably, the name feed was chosen to fit into the whole &#8220; consumer &#8221; motif. Personally, it makes me think of an exhibit in the zoo where there's just a dark cage with no trees or plants or
     evidence of life of any kind, but if you stand perfectly still and look really closely you can make out two beady eyes staring
     back at you from the far left corner, but you convince yourself that that's just your mind playing tricks on you, and the
     only way you can tell that the whole thing isn't just an empty cage is a small innocuous sign on the railing that reads, &#8220; Do not feed the parser. &#8221; But maybe that's just me. In any event, it's an interesting mental image.

    You can use recursive wget for the editorials. 

 Note, however, that redistributing these files is possibly a copyright violation, so they would have to be for private use only.

I removed old comments regarding issues that have been fixed before. 
 
Let me create a small FAQ about the problem set analysis page. 
 
 Q. Where is the editorial for SRM XXX? 
 Certain matches don&apos;t have editorials. A typical reason is that the SRM in question was a Member SRM. Member SRMs problem sets were completely voluntary work and many times no one wrote an editorial for them. In other situations, the SRM may have had technical issues strong enough to make it have no statistics. In some of those cases no editorial was added. 
 If a match misses a link here, it is usually because the editorial does not exist or is incomplete. However, if you do find an editorial that does not have a link in this page, please report it.

    I found SRM582 is not listed in Chronological list. 

 It's only listed in Child Page List. 

 Can someone add it?

    We didn't publish it officially because it is not finished.
